# jsj_scope v7_5 for pc xp x86
analog oscilloscope using sigrok command line "sigrok-cli.exe" and python34.dll and sigrok "share" directory. is a windows exe file execuitable .. dependant sigrok and python files included  works with xp
if it does not work install vcredist_x86.exe   it will explain it is from microsodft. it is a redistributable free library that containst c++ commands in dll files. it is klikely that you already  have it if you use shareware that is written in c++. i know pulseview needs it. i'm' not sure about sigrok. thanks jon james
JSJ.TXT is a sample file. if  you download this i9nto your run directory , it will show data as though the probe was connected even without the actual jsj_miniscope hardware probe
